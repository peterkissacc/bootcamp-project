This module performs a simple semantic retrieval test to validate the ChromaDB index.  
It loads the stored embeddings, performs similarity searches, and displays the most relevant tracks based on the user's natural language query.  
The script also demonstrates metadata filtering (e.g., filtering by genre) and verifies that the embedding and retrieval pipeline is functioning correctly.  
This test confirms that the vector store can return meaningful, grounded results before building more advanced RAG components.
